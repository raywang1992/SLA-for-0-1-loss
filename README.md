# SLA-for-0-1-loss
SLA method for 0-1 loss optimization\
This is the implementation of Smooth 0-1 Loss Approximation. The algorithm is created by Tan T. Nguyen and Scott Sanner.
The URL of their paper is:http://proceedings.mlr.press/v28/nguyen13a.pdf \
To run this code, simplely download all the files and put them in the same folder, and run SLA(x,t), while x is the input data and t is the coresponding label.
